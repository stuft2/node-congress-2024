# Open Source Software: Open Governance or for-profit Startups?

Open-source contributors working for a company aren't working to put themselves out of a job, but it's usually in the best interest of the company to ensure the longevity of the open-source code.

Companies that sponsor open-source are NOT liable to fix security vulnerabilities in the open-source code. The open source licenses ususally state,

> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS"

A model for software license that obliges companies to contribute financially to open-source that they consume would cause the companies to shrink away from the software. Instead, convince the company of the value and benefit and most companies will give back in some way. "Once you add royalties, you gamify the development, and that seems like it would impact the quality of the software."

Increasing popularity for the partner program (Ecosystem Sustainability Program) in the OpenJS Foundation where companies step up to give back to open-source, especially with the US Government mandating security.

New contributors have a lot of different places they can start working on. They can find working groups, bugs, or small enhancements to contribute at first.

Making sure your product is healthy when you depend on open-source, means you have an interest in contributing back to the open-source libraries you depend on.

Incentivizing more than just adding code, such as leaving reviews and adding tests or documentation, would lead to better quality of software.

Every open-source contributor should also work for an at-profit company so that they have benefits and salary. - *Robin Ginn*

Toward the end there was an interesting take from the audience that I particularly enjoyed:

**Question**: "I don't believe in a self regulating capitalistic market and have a huge european view/bias. over the years EU regulations forced international tech companies adhere to rules that insentives were not able to do on their own. I see where james [snell] is coming from, but I would love to see this in some kind of implementation in germany"

**Answer**: Enforcing regulations on the private sector is possible because they process personal data, but how would you enforce rules on open governance software that is distributed “as is?” You can't. The obligation is on those using the software, not on the software itself.
