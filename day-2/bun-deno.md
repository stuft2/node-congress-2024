# Will Bun or Deno Replace Node.js?

A discussion room with Richard Davidson, Tamar Twena-Stern, and Lucas Santos.

There are several engines competing with Node.js:

- Bun -> Improved performance over Node.js is making Node.js more competative.
- Deno -> Improved developer experience.
- QuickJS -> AWS LLRT (Low-Latency Runtime) targetting serverless environments

There was a quick discussion about loaders/importers (e.g. tsx) and the opinion was that they transpile only and provide no type checking.

https://jsr.io was mentioned as an alternative to the npm registry but it offers little besides automatic class documentation for TypeScript libraries.

I mentioned tsimp since it uses the TypeScript compiler from Microsoft and provides type checking but we ran out of time.
